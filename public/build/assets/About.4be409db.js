We look to the past, present, and future to tell a story about a place and the people that have created something that is both caught in the moment and timeless concurrently. We also want to bring an element of service and hospitality to the wine business. We strive to offer the same amazing experience to our members that are typically reserved for the upper echelon of the wine trade. We want to bring the wine to you, but also bring you to the wine if you are willing. We are focusing on the next wave of classic wine regions. Some parts of the wine world need more help in representation and having their story told than others. We look to the path less traveled. We introduced an e-commerce element that allows most consumers to access our wines from us at the same price they would pay at their local wine shop. Our wineries don\u2019t make that much wine, so we go direct as there\u2019s not enough for every corner of the country.
