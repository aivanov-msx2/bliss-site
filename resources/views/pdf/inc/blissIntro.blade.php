<p>Bliss Wine Imports travels the world to find unique wines that are always true to the land and its regional style. We only source wines from boutique family run wineries that offer a glimpse into these often overlooked regions. All of our wines are sustainably farmed without the use of chemicals that may negatively impact the land.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 by Alleah Friedrichs and Erin Geyer, Bliss Wine Imports was a project born from a passion for wine and learning. The ladies traveled extensively throughout Europe for nine months to find the initial portfolio. On their first trip to the Dão in Portugal they met João Tavares de Pina at João Tavares Wines who put them in touch with Andrey Ivanov. Now a Master Sommelier, a title he shares with 270 persons worldwide since 1969, Andrey also has a passion and a mission to bring these wines to the US and has been a part of the team since 2015 in the role of Director of Wholesale Accounts.</p>
