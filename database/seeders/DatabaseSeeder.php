The name of the wine, Caecus, is Latin for Elciego, the town where the vineyards are located. The logo on the bottle is a sketch of the beautiful church towers visible from the vineyard.
The vineyard lies on the Ebro River in the Rioja. Near the river the vineyard\'s soil is sandy. Limestone is concentrated in the upper part.

The mountains protect the area from the turbulent weather on both sides.', 'Luis\'s philosophy is fairly simple. Organic farming, manual harvesting, simple winemaking, clean, delicious and traditional wines. What makes this winery stand apart from the other Riojanos? Alavesa wines provide a much higher acidity and freshness to the wines, at lower alcohol levels as well. Luis\'s Crianza is on par with most producers\' Reservas.

João believes that the most important component of his winemaking is the fact that he lives in the middle of his vineyards. Natural yield, manual harvest and blending in vines. In the cellar, he is a strict non-interventionist; native yeasts for spontaneous coo fermentations, low sulphur and no more chemicals in cellar, no new wood, no fining, filtering, not even temperature control on his reds. He ages his wines in chestnut, 1300/1800l, until he feels they are perfectly ready for release, a luxury not enjoyed by many corners of the wine world. The vineyard is not tilled, so as to not disturb the biodiversity underneath, and utilizes native flowers and herbs as natural repellents to fungus, mold, and other diseases. The cover crop includes, but is not limited to, chamomile, clover, and serradella. At the end of each row are indigenous lavender signaling any oncoming disease. The vineyards themselves are surrounded by oak, pine, and eucalyptus. Lots of species of birds, bees, ladybirds, ants, and earthworms populate the ecosystem of the vineyard.

One of the hallmark features of the winery in the recent decade is the move to work with the Nebbiolo Rosé clone in his vineyards. There are three clones of Nebbiolo, Limpia, Michet, and the ancestral Rosé. The latter is harder to cultivate, and fell victim to the switch to higher yielding farming in the 1950s. Prior to this era, the producers in the region worked with the Rosé clone as the primary example of Nebbiolo, but the new Michet clone changed that over the next two decades. By the late 1970s, most of the new vineyards in Piedmont were planted to the tamer new clone, and still are today. The Rosé clone is much closer in style and flavor to the traditional wines of Piemonte made over the last eight centuries.

When she was young she read many novels by Beppe Fenoglio and Cesare Pavese, where both described the fascinating Langhe, its people and their life during the partisan war in that area. From their books you can also draw vivid images of the Langhe, a land of wine, cheese, meat and good food.” 
Inspired by travel through Spain, specifically Jerez, she developed a passion for wine and vines. Her husband Giovanni hails from Conegliano, and has family history in the vineyard as well. He always dreamed of one day growing his own vines. In the early nineties, their daughter Cristina was born and they decided to move away from the city and search for a house in the Langhe. After a long search, one day we found an old, abandoned farmstead on a hillside, surrounded by vines. The next years were very challenging and busy, renovating the farmstead while still maintaining the original structure and materials, and then starting to cultivate our vines next to the house. 
Over the years, Renata built her personal expertise in grape growing and wine making. They planted their first vineyard in 2006 and the second in 2009, followed by others. All the wines are produced using grapes cultivated in estate vineyards. We consider that good wine starts with an excellent grape, grown in a well-kept vineyard. 
As the years went by, new parcels were added to the property. These are located in the neighboring villages of Santo Stefano, Belbo, and Mango. By 2007 Renata owned more than 6 hectares (15 acres) of vineyards. The first vintage of Moscato d’Asti was produced in 2008 to the tune of 3000 bottles. The following year we produced our Langhe Favorita, followed by Dolcetto d’Alba in 2012. In 2013, she produced the first vintage of Dorè, a passito wine made from Moscato grapes.

The company was created in 1979 with a few vineyards coming from Yann\'s grandfather who was a shoemaker. This lack of an established and family-based wine making tradition was very challenging for André and Anna, Yann’s parents, because the whole business had to be built from scratch. It was also an opportunity as the company was not limited by traditional customs and therefore has always been oriented toward innovation.
Yann has been managing the winemaking since 2008, and the entire company since 2018. He has completed some formal winemaking studies but considers that he learned more by practice and sharing experiences with colleagues.

The best description of their philosophy is “agro-ecology.” They consider their farm as an ecosystem in which they try to find a balance between their various flora of vines, fruit trees for juice and spirits, and grass for sheep.

Durrmann\'s vineyards are settled on steep and rocky hills, so their soils are left covered in grass to prevent soil erosion and to help maintain their natural fertility. In addition, they do not plow the soil and maintain a cover crop year round to store more and more carbon in this humus, so as to help in the struggle against climate change. André has also planted trees in and around the vineyards to act as a natural umbrella to shade the vines. He hopes to curtail the effects of climate warming while preserving freshness in the wines.
In 2004, Yann introduced sheep into his vineyards where they enjoy the grass every autumn and naturally fertilize the fields.
He cultivated his vines without cutting branches during summer because it hurts the plant and goes again the natural character of the vine. He rolls up the branches to have an expanded surface area to receive sunshine. This vitality allows them to harvest fully ripened grapes and have a natural ripe fruit character in the wines. Underground, sap nourishes the microbial life surrounding the roots. In addition to enriching the soil, proper function of these mycorrhizae offers well-structured wines, heavily influenced by the mineral soil of the different Terroirs.

The vines are dry farmed allowing the ancient laterite, clay and granite soils to shine through and imbue our finished wines. As a viticulturist Chris’s focus has and always will be the vineyard, it is a simple yet complex philosophy, where respect for the site and natural ecosystem is paramount, ensuing profoundly structured wine pulsating with energy from this carefully nurtured land. The vineyard was being farmed organically and we were in our first year of our organic certification. Our farming techniques are based on observation and regenerative agriculture. We do not till our soils, organic cover crops consisting of radish, clovers, rye grass and peas are direct seeded ensuring that the soil structure remains in tact and the carbon is retained within the soil. The winter weeds are turned into mulch under the vines when Chris goes through with a whipper snipper each year. This ensures that our ground is covered during the hot, dry summers that the region experiences. All vines were cane pruned by Chris with the cuttings and cover crops mulched and dispersed under the vines. The grapes for this wine come from the oldest vines on our property, which are planted in well drained loam over gravel and ironstone.', '2500 cases', '16 hectares', 'Chris\' hobbies are surfing, surfing and surfing.

Noel is a deeply passionate person who has been one of the pioneers of natural winemaking in California. Noel started winemaking in 2013 and today has created a winemaking space in the Bay Area for 14 natural winemakers. He has two sons and a wife who has recently joined his team to help fund his expanding winery. Noel is a deeply sensitive guy who is very in tune with the land he works and his grapes. He stands behind what he does and believes in total transparency with methods of grape growing and winemaking. He believes if you do something to a wine, you had better be ready to share that with everyone. \"I love that natural wine is so honest and pure.  We’re not afraid to show our blemishes, our normalcy, our weaknesses, but in the same time, exposing our soulful beauty.\"', 'Noel\'s farming philosophy is as simple as \"do no harm\" on your land. Organic farming is just a start, meaning not using any synthetic chemicals. He likes to mention (and so do we!) that sustainable farming is not the same... it might be better than conventional but still uses synthetic chemicals. He goes beyond organic farming and is a practicer and preacher of \"regenerative farming\" which isn\'t always organic, however, he practices it organically. This means that it is important to create biodiversity and competition in the land to best encourage the ecosystem to thrive. In addition, he believes in \"no-till\" farming as to not disturb the land and fungal systems that are critical to healthy land. As for making wine, Noel really believes in aiding the grape to do what it wants to do. His wines are all native fermented and left unfiltered. He rarely uses sulfur. He strictly believes that if a winemaker will use a product like color, acid, yeasts, sulfur, velcorin, or any of the approved chemicals, then they should at least have the decency to tell you what they added to the wine in an ingredient list on the label. We love how all of Noel\'s bottles come with his detailed notes on how he made the wine including things like sulfur additions. However, rarely has he added or done much to the juice. He understands his grapes and has a target of how those grapes should be at harvest (sugar and acid levels) but then after harvest takes a good look at the grapes and decides how to make the best wine.

We have to say that they were not easy beginnings, since our experience was based entirely on the management of the vineyard, and we had never produced wine in a professional way, so we did successive tests that failed in the garage at home while we were gaining experience. With the help of friends and family and the experience gained, we finally managed to make what we liked, a wine that defends our best terroir.

And since our ambition is to grow in quality, we decided to acquire new vineyards in different locations driven by a passion that is to know, develop and manage those plots in locations completely different from what we were used to.

The native yeasts found in those vineyards then inoculate each batch and those batches are used to inoculate the rest of the vineyard. This means each single vineyard wine is inoculated with only the yeasts indigenous to that vineyard. 13 month maturation in 1500L barrels (20% new).', 'Hannes belongs to the STK group which only consists of 10 classical Styrian wineries that pool their resources to promote the quality of Styrian wines. Winemaking is very difficult in this area because of the rain and recent trend of hail throughout the growing season. As it is very difficult to be truly organic here we are excited to work with Hannes who does his best to farm as clean as possible and set a new standard in the region. Due to the region\'s influence from the Adriatic Sea to the south, it is quite warm and humid here. Grapes must be grown on slopes at least 200 meters up so as to protect them from rot. The slopes should also face south, east, or west to escape the cold northerly wind in the winter months. It is one of the few net wine importing regions in the world, meaning they bring in more wine from the outside than they actually produce!', 'Sturgeon, Chicken, Pork, Scallops, Escargot, Basil

This is a hybrid grape specifically resistant to frost and mold, thus being a good candidate for the base of this wine. The resistance to vineyard pressures virtually guarantees there is a base for the solera to be blended with every year.

In the case of the Syrah, the solera was started in 2017 and has four vintages of rose so far. The 2020 Syrah was short-macerated for just a few hours to extract color, then pressed. The two soleras are kept in stainless steel tanks to preserve freshness and structure. The Roesler is fresh each year and goes into qvevri (Georgian amphorae) after being direct pressed, so almost no contact with skins.

The rainfalls also cause some problems we have to solve: We have to prevent the growth of fungus diseases like Oidium and Peronospora. One of the most important things for us is to bring out organic compost in the vineyards every year to liven up the soil. Only a living soil can support and strengthen the vines. In every second row we plant a green cover with different plant species and into the other row we bring out some straw that we get from the neighbouring organic farms.

South-west exposure at 500 meters. Hannes is very committed to clean and sustainable farming which is difficult in this very wet region. Just prior to harvesting the entire vineyard, Hannes Sabathi picks a few bunches early and crushes them into small fermenters that he has strategically placed throughout each vineyard. The native yeasts found in those vineyards then inoculate each batch and those batches are used to inoculate the rest of the vineyard. This means each single vineyard wine is inoculated with only the yeasts indigenous to that vineyard.', 'After harvest, the wine is vinified in three separate ways. Fermentation takes place in stainless steel, utilizing the vineyard specific yeasts mentioned above. After fermentation, the wine is matured for 13 months in a variety of vessels. 50% goes into 1500L oak barrels (20% new), 25% goes into steel, 25% goes into concrete. Prior to maturation, the wine is filtered through kieselguhr. This is a type of local stone that is chalky white in color and has a very porous nature. The rock is fragmented with many tiny nooks and crannies that act as a perfect microfilter for particles left in the wine.

The dry and calm conditions during flowering resulted in a healthy and evenly distributed crop with lots of small berries across all varieties and Cabernet Sauvignon in particular. This would eventually result in excellent concentration and flavour development down the track. Temperatures were moderate throughout the growing season without any severe heat waves, and the vines received just the right amount of rain at regular intervals. Unlike the 2017 vintage disease pressure was minimal, and the Marri trees on our property were flowering at the right time thus keeping the birds away from the fruit. The canopies remained very healthy without showing any signs of stress throughout. The entire vineyard was looking so healthy that in the days leading up to harvest it seemed like there was an almost luminescent glow about it. Overall, the summer was a relatively mild one allowing for a long growing season, the extended hanging times facilitating the development of outstanding depth of flavors and aromatics in the musts. The resulting wines are layered and showing unparalleled complexity even at a very early stage. There can be little doubt that 2018 will be remembered as one of Margaret River’s all-time vintages.

This led to a later harvest, which, similarly to 2017, didn’t commence until early March and continued for many until late April. Chris had also spent many hours in the vineyard focusing on canopy management, ensuring good airflow and consistent sun exposure among the vines. This meant we had a healthy vineyard with very little disease pressure, and grapes in perfect balance. Fortunately for us, because of Chris’s hard work in the vineyard, and lower than average crops our whites had all been handpicked prior to the heavy rain which the region experienced. As a result, the rain energised the soil for the red varieties that ripened slowly in moderate temperatures over the following month/s. There have naturally been some comparisons to the 2017 vintage, given there are some similarities, however the yield from 2019 was inevitably lower. We struggled with both bird and bee pressure due to a complete absence of Marri blossom in the region. 2019 is a year where it will become apparent as to the work that was put into the vineyard, Chris has never spent so much time in the vineyard throughout harvest as he did this year, it was however necessary to ensure that only pristine quality fruit was handpicked. Vineyard management with regards to organics and cover crops the same as the Cabernet. Produced from our two more mineral based sites, Violette’s and Lucas’ blocks four clones of Chardonnay have been planted to bring complex layers and interest from the vineyard site. Half of Violette’s block has North South facing rows, this is where the power for our Chardonnay originates, the East West facing rows in Violette’s block delivering the grapefruit core and contributing the natural acidity. Lucas’s block provides a more subtle stone fruit and linear minerality. The fruit’s integrity has remained intact with subtle secondary notes of poached pear and flint merely complementing the vibrant aromas of white nectarine, grapefruit and curry leaf. On the palate this wine leaves no doubt of its intentions – it is intense and textural, yet fresh and lively, finding the perfect balance between richness and finesse.', 'Hand picked, whole bunch pressed straight to oak.

It has the highest elevation and also features a natural spring that runs in a South Westerly direction into Quininup Brook, the opposite direction of the spring in Violette’s block.

The weather pattern over this period was very favorable, however, and so we saw very even and consistent flowering and fruit set was excellent. In anticipation of a cool vintage Chris decided early on to do lots of additional work in the vineyard, which really paid off when the summer months that followed proved to be unusually cool and saw above average levels of rainfall. Throughout spring he had thinned out the crowns in order to open up the canopies and promote airflow, and the red varieties were all heavily leaf plucked around the bunches to give the fruit ample sun light exposure in order to ensure full phenolic ripeness was achieved even in this cool vintage. There’s no denying it was a long and arduous vintage this year, it was actually the latest on record for us. But the results more than justify the effort, and the fact that several of our hand pickers commented on our fruit being the cleanest they had picked this season is testament to the effectiveness of Chris’ hands-on approach to managing our little vineyard.', 'Great care is taken to handle the fruit as gently as possible throughout all the processing stages.

Winemaking is very difficult in this area because of the rain and recent trend of hail throughout the growing season. The slopes are very steep making the manual harvesting a difficult task.  As it is very difficult to be truly organic here we are excited to work with Hannes who does his best to farm as clean as possible and set a new standard in the region. Due to the region\'s influence from the Adriatic Sea to the south, it is quite warm and humid here. Grapes must be grown on slopes at least 200 meters up so as to protect them from rot. The slopes should also face south, east, or west to escape the cold northerly wind in the winter months. It is one of the few net wine importing regions in the world, meaning they bring in more wine from the outside than they actually produce!
